Storehouse e-commcerce
Rails app for making purchases with or without an account.

Project Goals
This started as a simple back end Rails project. I wanted to extend some of my ruby knowledge and play around with the front-end aspect of building a web app as well, so I decided to spend more time on the css media queries. Also it is my first time implementing Stripe, to take purchases. This is currently an ongoing project.

How the app works
Go to https://commerce-storehouse.herokuapp.com/. You can choose to sign in or not before selecting an item to add to yout cart. Account holders have the benefit of having their purchase history saved to their account. Also admin users have a detailed layout of the websites inventory.

Note: I havent fully implemented the purchasing funciton in stripe, because this is meant to be an ongoing demo project.
